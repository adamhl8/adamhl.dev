title: "Which npm package has the largest version number?"

I was recently working on a project that uses the [AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3). When updating the dependencies in said project, I noticed that the version of that dependency was `v3.888.0`. Eight hundred eighty eight. That's a big number as far as versions go.

That got me thinking: I wonder what package in the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com) has the largest number in its version. It could be a major, minor, or patch version, and it doesn't have to be the latest version of the package. In other words, out of the three numbers in `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` for each version for each package, what is the largest number I can find?

**TL;DR? [Jump to the results](#results)** to see the answer.

## The npm API

Obviously npm has some kind of API, so it shouldn't be too hard to get a list of all... [3,639,812 packages](https://www.npmjs.com/#:~:text=Packages-,3%2C639%2C812,-Downloads%20%C2%B7%20Last). Oh. That's a lot of packages. Well, considering npm had 374 _billion_ package downloads in the past _month_, I'm sure they wouldn't mind me making a few million HTTP requests.

Doing a quick search for "npm api" leads me to a readme in the [npm/registry repo](https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/main/docs/REGISTRY-API.md) on GitHub. There's a `/-/all` endpoint listed in the table of contents which seems promising. That section doesn't actually exist in the readme, but maybe it still works?

```sh
$ curl 'https://registry.npmjs.org/-/all'
{"code":"ResourceNotFound","message":"/-/all does not exist"}
```

Whelp, maybe npm packages have an ID and I can just start at 1 and count up? It looks like packages have an `_id` field... never mind, the `_id` field is the package _name_. Okay, let's try to find something else.

A little more digging brings me to this [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/152515) about the npm replication API. So npm replicates package info in CouchDB at `https://replicate.npmjs.com`, and conveniently, they support the [`_all_docs` endpoint](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/database/bulk-api.html#db-all-docs). Let's give that a try:

```sh
$ curl 'https://replicate.npmjs.com/registry/_all_docs'
{
   "total_rows" : 3628088,
   "offset" : 0,
   "rows" : [
      {
         "id" : "-",
         "key" : "-",
         "value" : {
            "rev" : "5-f0890cdc1175072e37c43859f9d28403"
         }
      },
      {
         "id" : "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------whynunu",
         "key" : "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------whynunu",
         "value" : {
            "rev" : "1-1d26131b0f8f9702c444e061278d24f2"
         }
      },
      {
         "id" : "-----hsad-----",
         "key" : "-----hsad-----",
         "value" : {
            "rev" : "1-47778a3a6f9d8ce1e0530611c78c4ab4"
         }
      },
      # 997 more packages...
```

Those are some interesting package names. Looks like this data is paginated and by default I get 1,000 packages at a time. When I write the final script, I can set the `limit` query parameter to the max of 10,000 to make pagination a little less painful.

Fortunately, the CouchDB docs have a [guide for pagination](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/ddocs/views/pagination.html#paging), and it looks like it's as simple as using the `skip` query parameter.

```sh
$ curl 'https://replicate.npmjs.com/registry/_all_docs?skip=1000'
"Bad Request"
```

Never mind. According to the GitHub discussion linked above, `skip` is no longer supported. The "Paging (Alternate Method)" section of the same page says that I can use `startkey_docid` instead. If I grab the `id` of the last row, I should be able to use that to return the next set of rows. Fun fact: The 1000th package (alphabetically) on npm is `03-webpack-number-test`.

```sh
$ curl 'https://replicate.npmjs.com/registry/_all_docs?startkey_docid="03-webpack-number-test"'
{
    "total_rows" : 3628102,
    "offset" : 999,
    "rows" : [
    # another 1000 packages...
```

Nice. Also, another `3628102 - 3628088 = 14` packages have been published in the ~15 minutes since I ran the last query.

Now, there's one more piece of the puzzle to figure out. How do I get all the versions for a given package? Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like I can get package version information along with the base info returned by `_all_docs`. I have to _separately_ fetch each package's metadata from `https://registry.npmjs.org/<package_id>`. Let's see what good ol' trusty `03-webpack-number-test` looks like:

```sh
$ curl 'https://registry.npmjs.org/03-webpack-number-test'
{
    # i've omitted some fields here
    "_id" : "03-webpack-number-test",
    "versions" : {
      "1.0.0" : { ... },
      # the rest of the versions...
```

Alright, I have everything I need. Now I just need to write a bash script thatâ€” just kidding. A wise programmer once said, "if your shell script is more than 10 lines, it shouldn't be a shell script" (that was me, I said that). I like TypeScript, so let's use that.

The biggest bottleneck is going to be waiting on the `GET`s for each package's metadata. My plan is this:

- Grab all the package IDs from the replication API and save that data to a file (I don't want to have to refetch everything if the something goes wrong later in the script)
- Fetch package data in batches so we're not just doing 1 HTTP request at a time
- Save the package data to a file (again, hopefully I only have to fetch everything once)

Once I have all the package data, I can answer the original question of "largest number in version" and look at a few other interesting things.

(A few hours and many iterations later...)

```sh
$ bun npm-package-versions.ts
Fetching package IDs...
Fetched 10000 packages IDs starting from offset 0
# this goes on for a while...
Finished fetching package IDs
Fetched 50 packages in 884ms (57 packages/s)
Fetched 50 packages in 852ms (59 packages/s)
# this goes on for a really long while...
```

See the [script section](#script) at the end if you want to see what it looks like.

## Results

Some stats:

- Time to fetch all ~3.6 million package _IDs_: **A few minutes**
- Time to fetch version data for each one of those packages: **~12 hours** (yikes)
- Packages fetched per second: **~84 packages/s**
- Size of `package-ids.json`: **~78MB**
- Size of `package-data.json`: **~886MB**

**And the winner is...** (not really) [latentflip-test](https://www.npmjs.com/package/latentflip-test?activeTab=versions) at version `1000000000000000000.1000000000000000000.1000000000000000000`. And no, there haven't actually been one quintillion major versions of this package published. Disappointing, I know.

Okay, I feel like that shouldn't count. I think we can do better and find a "real" package that actually follows semantic versioning. I think a better question to ask is this:

**For packages that _follow semantic versioning_, which package has the _largest number_ from `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` in _any_ of its versions?**

So, what does it mean to "follow semantic versioning"? Should we "disqualify" a package for skipping a version number? In this case, I think we'll just say that a package has to have more versions published than the largest number we find for that package. For example, a package with a version of `1.888.0` will have had _at least_ 888 versions published if it actually followed semver.

Before we get to the real winner, here are the top 10 packages _by total number of versions published_:

```
1. electron-remote-control -> 37328 total versions
2. @npm-torg/public-scoped-free-org-test-package-2 -> 37134 total versions
3. public-unscoped-test-package -> 27719 total versions
4. carrot-scan -> 27708 total versions
5. @npm-torg/public-test-package-2 -> 27406 total versions
6. @octopusdeploy/design-system-components -> 26724 total versions
7. @octopusdeploy/type-utils -> 26708 total versions
8. @octopusdeploy/design-system-tokens -> 22122 total versions
9. @mahdiarjangi/phetch-cli -> 19498 total versions
10. @atlassian-test-prod/hello-world -> 19120 total versions
```

Top 10 packages that (probably) follow semver _by largest number in one of its versions_:

```
1. @mahdiarjangi/phetch-cli -> 19494 (1.0.19494)
2. electron-remote-control -> 19065 (1.2.19065)
3. @quip/collab -> 16999 (1.16999.0)
4. @atlassian-test-prod/hello-world -> 16707 (9.7.16707)
5. @wix/wix-code-types -> 14720 (2.0.14720)
6. @octopusdeploy/design-system-components -> 14274 (2025.3.14274)
7. @octopusdeploy/type-utils -> 14274 (2025.3.14274)
8. @octopusdeploy/design-system-tokens -> 14274 (2025.3.14274)
9. @atlassian-test-staging/test -> 13214 (49.4.13214)
10. binky -> 9906 (3.4.9906)
```

So it seems like the winner is [@mahdiarjangi/phetch-cli](https://github.com/DinoscapeProgramming/Remote-Control) with `19494`, right? Unfortunately, I'm not going to count that either. It only has so many versions because of a [misconfigured GitHub action](https://github.com/arjangimahdi/phetch-cli/actions/runs/11531682007/workflow) that published new versions in a loop.

I manually went down the above list, disqualifying any packages that had similar issues. I also checked that "new" versions actually differed from previous versions in terms of content. Overall, I looked for a package that was actually publishing new versions on purpose with _some_ kind of change to the package content.

**The real winner (#19 on the list) is:** [all-the-package-names](https://github.com/nice-registry/all-the-package-names) with `2401` from version `2.0.2401`.

Well, that's sort of disappointing, but also kind of funny. I don't know what I was expecting to be honest. If you're curious, you can see [more results](#more-results) at the bottom of this post.

What you do with all of this extremely important and useful information is up to you.
