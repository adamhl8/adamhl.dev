Astro has [since updated](https://github.com/withastro/astro/releases/tag/astro%405.13.0) their environment variable handling, so some of the information in this post may be outdated.

This post is in the context of an Astro project, but most of what I'm talking about is generally applicable to any TypeScript/JavaScript project.

While building an Astro project, I ran into some issues with environment variables. Astro gives a neat way of defining a [type-safe environment variable schema](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/#type-safe-environment-variables) so that environment variables are validated before running/building your site. Astro will throw helpful error messages if there are any environment variables that don't meet the requirements.

These are accessed via an import like this:

```ts
import { SECRET_TOKEN } from "astro:env/server" // SECRET_TOKEN is of type 'string'. No need to check for undefined!
```

Also, Astro automatically loads environment variables in our `.env` files. They are also made available in `import.meta.env` (this is relevant later).

All of this combined gives us what we want:

- Environment variables are automatically loaded from our `.env` files
- Environment variables are validated before running/building the application
- Environment variables can be accessed without having to check for `undefined`

But, like I mentioned, I ran into some issues.

Importing from `astro:env` is only possible when in the Astro context.

<Callout type="note">

I mention the "Astro context" a lot. This just means that you're using some astro command (`astro dev`, `astro build`, etc.) or running your Astro backend in production.

</Callout>

A good example of where this becomes an issue is when I set up my [drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team) client:

```ts title=db.ts
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client"
import { DB_FILE_NAME } from "astro:env/server"
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/libsql"

const client = createClient({ url: DB_FILE_NAME })
export const db = drizzle({ client })
```

Here, `DB_FILE_NAME` is being loaded from my `.env` file.

This works fine when running the Astro dev server or in production. However, I have a `seed.ts` script that imports the drizzle client (which imports `astro:env/server`) to set up the database for development. Unsurprisingly, this script fails because `astro:env` is not available.

```ts title=seed.ts
import { db } from "./db" // Throws an error
import { seed } from "drizzle-seed"

await seed(db, { ... })
```

To be clear about the problem here: `seed.ts` is being executed directly, so I need some way of accessing environment variables that doesn't rely on it being imported/executed under Astro.

So, we can use `process.env`, throw a non-null assertion on it, and call it a day, right? We lose our typed environment variables, but we'll get to that later.

```ts title=db.ts
const client = createClient({ url: process.env.DB_FILE_NAME! })
```

Also, if you're wondering, remember that we can't use `import.meta.env` in this case because it's not populated with our environment variables outside of the Astro context.

**There are two immediate problems with this approach:**

- In the Astro context, even though it loads our `.env` file, `process.env` is not populated with our environment variables.
- When run as a script, Node doesn't load our `.env` file at all.

We can fix both of these problems by using something like [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv), which will populate `process.env` from `.env` in both cases. (This is actually what [drizzle recommends](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started/sqlite-new#step-3---connect-drizzle-orm-to-the-database) you do in the first place.)

Separately, there are parts of my site that need to be aware of what environment I'm in (e.g. dev vs prod). Astro sets some [default environment variables](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/#default-environment-variables) on `import.meta.env` (but _not_ on `process.env`) that I can use for this (e.g. `import.meta.env.DEV`).

Alright, this got complicated. Now I'm accessing environment variables in three ways:

- `astro:env` for my typed environment variables (only accessible in the Astro context)
- `process.env` (plus `dotenv`) for environment variables I need to access both in and outside of the Astro context (e.g. in scripts)
- `import.meta.env` for environment variables specific to Astro

I'm gonna go ahead and say this is not ideal.

## Bun solves all of our problems

So, the question becomes, _is there a consistent, safe way to access environment variables in all contexts?_

Let's be specific about what we want to achieve. The solution should:

- Work in all contexts (Astro, scripts, etc.)
- Validate environment variables before running/building the application
- Provide _one_ way to access environment variables
- Automatically load environment variables from `.env` files
- Be type-safe (no `undefined` checks or non-null assertions)

Is this possible? Yes, with some caveats/gotchas.

Let's break down the problem a little bit more:

- We know that `astro:env` is never available outside of the Astro context, so that's a no go. We want something that works in all contexts.
- In the Astro context, `import.meta.env` has all of our environment variables _plus_ the additional properties added by Astro.
- Knowing that, it would make sense to use `import.meta.env` by default.
- Then the problem we're really trying to solve is: _how do we populate `import.meta.env` **outside** of the Astro context?_
- If we solve that, using `import.meta.env` for everything will "just work".

We've been assuming that we're using Node as our runtime. If we use Bun instead, a lot of our problems go away.

Bun does two main things that help us out here:

1. It automatically loads environment variables from `.env` files, so we don't need to use `dotenv`.
2. It loads environment variables into _both_ `process.env` and `import.meta.env`. More specifically, Bun makes [`import.meta.env` an alias of `process.env`](https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/env#reading-environment-variables).

To be clear about why this works and what's happening:

- Outside of the Astro context, Bun automatically loads our `.env` files and populates `import.meta.env`, so we're good there.
- Inside the Astro context, for example when running `astro dev`, Astro does the same.

```ts file=db.ts
// Now when I run my `seed.ts` script, Bun will make `DB_FILE_NAME` available.
const client = createClient({ url: import.meta.env.DB_FILE_NAME! })
```

> _So, just use `import.meta.env` everywhere and I'm good?_

Yep, pretty much. **However, there is one edge-case we have to deal with.**

## The `--bun` flag

One important difference between Bun and Node is that Node does not allow you to use `import.meta` in CommonJS modules. In fact, trying to access `import.meta` in a CommonJS module will throw an error: `SyntaxError: Cannot use 'import.meta' outside a module`.

> _Why are we talking about Node? Aren't we using Bun anyway?_

By default, Bun respects scripts, binaries, etc. that execute Node. For example, running `bun run vite` will execute the `vite` "binary", which is actually just a JavaScript file with a Node shebang `#!/usr/bin/env node`. As expected, this will execute the file with Node, not Bun.

<Callout type="info">

Astro is the same way. If you look at the `astro` "binary" in your `node_modules`, it's just a JavaScript file with a Node shebang.

</Callout>

I ran into this when trying to run the `drizzle-kit push` command with Bun. At some point, `drizzle-kit` imports my `drizzle.config.ts` which uses `import.meta.env.DB_FILE_NAME`. I was getting the following error:

```
"import.meta" is not available with the "cjs" output format and will be empty
```

This usually isn't a problem since most things are ESM nowadays. When executing something with Node, only things that are themselves CJS or load other files as CJS will have this issue.

Bun handles executing CJS files much more gracefully. It allows you to use `import.meta.env` inside of them without issue.

So what if we could "trick" these kinds of scripts/binaries to run with Bun instead of Node?

Bun allows you to do exactly that with the `--bun, -b` flag. Now when we execute something like `bun run vite`, it'll run with Bun, not Node. See the [Bun docs](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/run#bun) for more details.

This is the final piece of the puzzle. With this, everything works as expected.

## The solution

Like I mentioned above, my suggestion is to **not use `astro:env` at all** and instead use `import.meta.env` everywhere. You can/should still define your [environment variable schema](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/#type-safe-environment-variables) so you can validate your expected environment variables.

<Callout type="tip">

**Update (Jun 12, 2025)**: Astro's built-in environment variable validation (`astro:env`) has some other frustrating limitations, so I made an Astro integration as an alternative: [astro-validate-env](https://github.com/adamhl8/astro-validate-env)

</Callout>

There's still one thing we haven't solved, **what about our typed environment variables?**

Fortunately, there's an [easy way to type](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/#intellisense-for-typescript) `import.meta.env`.

In a `env.d.ts` file:

```ts title="env.d.ts"
interface ImportMetaEnv {
  readonly DB_FILE_NAME: string
  // more env variables...
}

interface ImportMeta {
  readonly env: ImportMetaEnv
}
```

To recap, this is what I've found to be the best approach:

- Use Bun (with the `--bun` flag) to automatically load `.env` files and populate `import.meta.env`
- Define all of your environment variables in your [environment variable schema](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/#type-safe-environment-variables)
- Type your environment variables in your `env.d.ts` file
- _Don't_ use `astro:env`
- Use `import.meta.env` everywhere

There's nothing wrong with using `astro:env`, but a Astro environment variable schema + a typed `import.meta.env` is basically the same thing.

### Some gotchas

- There should be a 1:1 mapping between your environment variable schema and your typed `import.meta.env`.
  - If have something in your `import.meta.env` but not in your environment variable schema and you forget to set that environment variable, you now have a variable that will show as `string` but is actually `undefined`.
- Outside of the Astro context, the Astro-specific values will be `undefined` (e.g. don't try to access `import.meta.env.DEV` in scripts).
- Bun is made to be a drop-in replacement for Node, so using `--bun` _shouldn't_ break things, but it's possible that certain dependencies/binaries may not work as expected.

This solution is definitely not perfect, but it's a lot better than what I was doing before.
