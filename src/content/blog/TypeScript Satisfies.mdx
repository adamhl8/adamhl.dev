I recently discovered the [TypeScript `satisfies` operator](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-9.html) which solves a particular typing problem I've come across time and time again.

<Callout type="summary" title="The `satisfies` operator">

In a nutshell, it ensures that something conforms to a specific type while _also_ giving that thing the most specific (inferred) type.

</Callout>

Let's say we have an object where the keys are strings and the values are objects. And we know that in the future we might add another section like `section3`.

```ts
const sections = {
  section1: {
    detail1: "",
  },
  section2: {
    detail1: "",
  },
}
```

Sometimes we might want a type that is the _keys_ of our `sections` object.

```ts
type SectionNames = keyof typeof sections
// The actual inferred type looks like:
// type SectionNames = "section1" | "section2"
```

Cool, now we have type called `SectionNames` that is very specifically one of two string literals (`section1` or `section2`).

But wait, we want the `sections` object to conform to a specific shape. Specifically, we want two things:

- We want to be able to add additional sections to the object
- Each section should be an object that has the key `detail1` with a `string` value

So we might do something like:

```ts
interface SectionDetails {
  detail1: string
}

const sections: Record<string, SectionDetails> = {
  section1: {
    detail1: "",
  },
  section2: {
    detail1: "",
  },
}
```

This allows us to add as many sections as we want (without having to _also_ add the same section key to some overall `Sections` interface) and each section must be an object with the specified key/value pairs.

There's a problem though. Let's look at what our `SectionNames` type looks like now:

```ts
type SectionNames = keyof typeof sections
// Now section names is:
// type SectionNames = string
```

Now `SectionNames` is just of type `string`.

Because we typed `sections` as `Record<string, SectionDetails>`, TypeScript is no longer inferring the more specific type.

So the question is, how can we ensure that `sections` conforms to the shape we want while also having our `SectionNames` type be the exact keys and not just `string`?

This is where the `satisfies` operator comes in. Instead of specifying the type of `sections`, we say it must _satisfy_ some type:

```ts
const sections = {
  section1: {
    detail1: "",
  },
  section2: {
    detail1: "",
  },
} satisfies Record<string, SectionDetails>
// Still the specific inferred type!
// And sections must satisfy the defined type.

type SectionNames = keyof typeof sections
// type SectionNames = "section1" | "section2"
```
